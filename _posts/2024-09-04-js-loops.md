## Loops

### For-of loop

This loop is handy if we're iterating items in a list :

```js
const spotifyTopTen = new Array(
    "Paint My Soul", "The Nights",
    "Send Them Off!", "Everlasting",
    "Good Grief", "Hangin'",
    "Soy Yo", "Walk",
    "Hey Brother", "My Blood"
);

for (let song of spotifyTopTen)
{
    console.log(song);
}
```
