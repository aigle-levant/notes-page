## JavaScript

JS is an programming language introduced in 1995 that lets you add scripting [actions] in webpages.

### Aren't Java and JavaScript the same?

People often think Java and JavaScript are the same language, or that JS is a subset of Java. This is **wrong**!

JavaScript, prior to release in September 1995, was called LiveScript. During that period, Java was gaining popularity, and so the creators decided to rename it to JavaScript to cruise this wave and here we are.

### Hello world!

Let's write our first program in JS. We create a HTML file and add in a `<script>` element in there :

```html
<script>
    console.log("Hello world!")
</script>
```

When you open the file in a browser, nothing happens. But, if you use inspect element and go to the console tab...

Hello world! ``console.log()`` works similar to Python's ``print()`` and Java's ``System.out.println();``

### Linking external JS

Just like linking a stylesheet, we can link an external script file to our file.

```html
<script src="fileName.js"></script>
```

### Variables

Unlike other languages, JS lets you declare variables in 3 ways [one way is depreciated, by the way].

```js
let one = 54
const two = 77
var three = 14

console.log(one, two, three)
```

`let` lets you define variables.

`const` lets you define variables that you can't change later on.

`var` is similar to `let`, but since it's depreciated we won't use it much.

> You can't assign a value to a variable AND perform some operation to it at the same time.

### Strings
