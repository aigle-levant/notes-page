## Data type

JS has 2 categories of data types : primitive and object.

### Primitive

This is the collection of JS' in-built data types. They can store only a single value of the specific data type.

**String** : Stores text values [called strings] that are assigned using quotes or template literals.

**Number** : Stores numeric values, be it integer or decimal.

**Boolean** : Returns either of its 2 values - `true` or `false`

**BigInt** : Stores large integers; is also created by appending `n` to end of an integer.

**`null`** : Stores only `null` as value

**Undefined** : Default value for any variable that's been declared, but not initialized.

**Symbol** : An unique identifier value with optional description

> Unlike other types, variables with `null` type can't be tested for type using `typeof` operator. It simply returns `object` if you do so.

### Object

It is a mutable data type representing anything that isn't a primitive. This includes arrays, functions, objects, etc.
