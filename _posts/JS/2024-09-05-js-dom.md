We shall now learn to put our JS into the web...

## Document Object Model

DOM is a tree-like representation of a webpage's content [like a binary tree or such].

Let's go back to HTML for a while...

```html
<div class="holder">
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote left">❝</span>
        <p class="text">I've got demons running 'round in my head</p>
        <p class="text">And they feed on insecurities I have</p>
        <p class="text">Won't you lay your healing hands on my chest?</p>
        <p class="text">Let your ritual clean</p>
        <span class="quote right">❞</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

`<div class="holder">` is the parent container of this part. Nested inside it are `<div class="content">`, and further in we have `<span>` and `<p>` elements. This works like a family tree with each part on its own branch.

### Working with DOM

When we use JS with HTML, we need a way to refer the elements of the page in the `<script>`. We use the element's selectors to do so :

```js
const element = document.querySelector("#content");
```
