We shall look into what an object is in JS...

## Object

> Refer -> [My notes on OOP, in case you don't know what an object is](2024-06-17-oop.md) and [notes on data types in JS](2024-09-08-js-dtypes.md)

Objects are the representation of real-world objects in the virtual world. In JS, they belong to a type called `object`.

### Creating an object

Objects can be created in 4 ways :

* Using an object initializer [or object literals]
* Using `new`
* Using a factory function
* Using a constructor

#### Object literals

Object is a collection of key-value pairs. These pairs represent an object's properties [in other languages, we call them instance variables].

> If you've dabbled in python before, you must be familiar with dictionaries. What we're going to do now resembles them.

Let's say I'm making a character for Project Zomboid...

```js
const player = {
    name: "Jean Antonique",
    job: "Ranger",
    traitsStengths: ["Outdoorsman", "Axe Man", ""],
    traitsWeakness: ["Thin-skinned", "Fear of Blood", ""],
    //...
    mainWeapon: "Axe"
};
```

Let's try printing the object :

```js
console.log(player);

/*
{
  name: 'Jean Antonique',
  job: 'Ranger',
  ...
  mainWeapon: 'Axe'
}
*/
```

Aww man! We don't need the EXACT thing we declare just moments ago!

To avoid this problem, we simply use the object's keys using an operator called dot operator [.] :

```js
let str = `Name: ${player.name}\nJob: ${player.job}`;

console.log(str);
/*
Name: Jean Antonique
Job: Ranger
*/
```

This operator lets you access the instance variables of an object.

We can also access them using `objectName['propertyName']`. This method's used when a property consists of many words that are separated by space [or if they're enclosed by single quotes].

```js
const player = {
    //...
    'traits strengths': ["Outdoorsman", "Axe Man", ""],
    'traits weakness': ["Thin-skinned", "Fear of Blood", ""],
    //...
};

console.log(player['traits strengths'] + '\n' + player['traits weakness']);

/*
[ 'Outdoorsman', 'Axe Man', '' ]
[ 'Thin-skinned', 'Fear of Blood', '' ]
*/
```

### Factory functions

Object literals are great if we're dealing with a single object. Not so great if we deal with stuff like this that involves duplication :

```js
const player = {
    name: "Jean Antonique",
    job: "Ranger",
    traitStrength: ["Outdoorsman", "Axe Man", ""],
    traitWeakness: ["Thin-skinned", "Fear of Blood", ""],
    jacket: "Wedding Suit",
    shirt: "Dress Shirt",
    pant: "Dress Pants",
    //...
    mainWeapon: "Axe"
};

const playerTwo = {
    name: "Yves Montagne",
    job: "Burger Flipper",
    traitStrength: ["Resilient", "Amateur Mechanic", ""],
    traitWeakness: ["Sunday Driver", "Conspicuous", ""],
    jacket: "Flannel",
    shirt: "Vest",
    pant: "Jeans",
    //...
    mainWeapon: "None"
};
```

> Remember the programmer's adage - **DRY : Don't Repeat Yourself**; don't duplicate unless necessary.

They even share the same properties, to our chagrin. We need some way to ease our workload. What shall we do?

We use factory functions :

```js
function createPLayer (playerName="Anonymous", playerJob="Unemployed", playerStrength, playerWeakness, playerJacket="None", playerShirt="Dress Shirt", playerPant="Jeans", playerWeapon="None")
{
    return {
        name: playerName,
        job: playerJob,
        traitStrength: playerStrength,
        traitWeakness: playerWeakness,
        jacket: playerJacket,
        shirt: playerShirt,
        pant: playerPant,
        //...
        mainWeapon: playerWeapon,
        playerInfo : function()
        {
            console.log(
                //prints arguments provided
            );
        }
    }
}

```

This allows us to create object as per our wish.

```js
const player = createPLayer("Jean Antonique", "Ranger", "Outdoorsman", "Fear of Blood", "Wedding Suit", "Dress Shirt", "Dress Pants", "Axe");

player.playerInfo()
```

Now I'll let you know a cool trick - if the key name and the value name [which comes from the function's parameters] are the same, we can get rid of the value name and just keep the key name alone :

```js
function createPLayer (playerName="Anonymous", job="Unemployed", strength, weakness, jacket="None", shirt="Dress Shirt", pant="Jeans", mainWeapon="None")
{
    return {
        playerName, job, strength, weakness, jacket,
        shirt, pant, mainWeapon,
        playerInfo : function()
        {
            console.log(
                //prints arguments provided
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Constructors

Another way is by using constructors. This word must be familiar to those who know Java or Python - yes, it's a way to create instances of a class. However, JS doesn't have the concept of classes; we'll have to settle with objects alone instead.

```js
function Player(playerName="Anonymous", playerJob="Unemployed", playerStrength, playerWeakness, playerJacket="None", playerShirt="Dress Shirt", playerPant="Jeans", playerWeapon="None")
{
    this.playerName = playerName;
    this.job = job;
    //...
    this.mainWeapon = this.mainWeapon;

    this.playerInfo = function()
    {
        //print the player's information
    }
}

const playerOne = new Player("Jean Antonique", "Ranger", "Outdoorsman", "Fear of Blood", "Wedding Suit", "Dress Shirt", "Dress Pants", "Axe");

```

Wow, it does resemble a Java class, complete with the `this` keyword and `private` instance variables!

Well, to those not in the know, `this` refers to the object involved here. We use it to point to the object instead of point at the program as a whole, allowing us to hide away the complexities of a program.
