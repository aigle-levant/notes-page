Let us learn about an important component of programming while studying JS...

## Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of items.

```js
const spotifyTopTen = [
    "The Nights", "Paint My Soul",
    "Send Them Off!", "Everlasting",
    "Good Grief", "Hangin'",
    "Soy Yo", "Walk",
    "Hey Brother", "My Blood"
]
```

We normally declare arrays with `const`. We can alternatively use the `new` keyword [I frequently use the former method since it's easier].

```js
const spotifyTopTen = new Array(
    "The Nights", "Paint My Soul",
    "Send Them Off!", "Everlasting",
    "Good Grief", "Hangin'",
    "Soy Yo", "Walk",
    "Hey Brother", "My Blood"
);
```

Now here's a warning : do not use `new Array()` to create arrays using a single number. You'll see here why :

```js
const song = new Array(45);
console.log(song);
//[ <45 empty items> ]
```

When we create an array using a single number, we get that number's worth of `undefined` elements as well. This doesn't work on any other type, however :

```js
const song = new Array(4.5);
console.log(song);

/*
RangeError: Invalid array length
at Object.<anonymous> (...\js\ohohoh.js:10:14)
*/
```

```js
const song = new Array("This has to be an array, at least");
console.log(song);
//[ 'This has to be an array, at least' ]
```

### Array operations

#### Accessing elements

We access elements using the array's name and index of the item :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen[3]); //Everlasting
console.log(spotifyTopTen[7]); //Walk
```

We do this using `at()` as well :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen.at(3)); //Everlasting
```

And we can also modify an array's values using its index :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen[9]); //My Blood
spotifyTopTen[9] = "Ride";
console.log(spotifyTopTen[9]); //Ride
```

Let's try accessing the last element of array :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen[-1]); //undefined
```

This happens as JS [just like its namesake] doesn't support negative indexing. If this were python, you'd have gotten the last item of the array. Let's try another way :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen[spotifyTopTen.length - 1]);
//My Blood
```

Or we simply use ``array.at(-1)`` to return the last item of the list.

#### Array to string

`toString()` must be a familiar method to those using Java. Here in JS, however, this method converts an array to a string of values separated by commas :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen.toString());
/*
The Nights,Paint My Soul,Send Them Off!,Everlasting,Good Grief,Hangin',Soy Yo,Walk,Hey Brother,My Blood
*/
```

Looks a bit too close for comfort; let's fix it :

```js
console.log(spotifyTopTen.join(", "));
/*
The Nights, Paint My Soul, Send Them Off!, Everlasting, Good Grief, Hangin', Soy Yo, Walk, Hey Brother, My Blood
*/
```

#### Looping through an array

We normally use a for loop to print items of a list :

```js
for (let i=0; i<spotifyTopTen.length; i++)
{
    console.log(spotifyTopTen[i]);
}
```

You can achieve the same using a while loop as well, but it is a bit tedious process :

```js
let i = 0;
while (i<spotifyTopTen.length)
{
    console.log(spotifyTopTen[i]);
    i++;
}
```

Now there exist other loops in JS quite suited for looping over a list.

#### Adding array elements

`push()` lets you add elements to your arrays. So does another method involving `length` :

```js
spotifyTopTen.push("Call It What You Want");
spotifyTopTen[spotifyTopTen.length] = "Song 2";
let len = spotifyTopTen.length;

console.log(spotifyTopTen + '\n\nLength is: ' + len);
```

Another way of doing this is `unshift()` :

```js
spotifyTopTen.unshift("Song 2");
console.log(spotifyTopTen);
console.log("Length: " + spotifyTopTen.length);

/*
'Song 2',
'Paint My Soul',
'The Nights',
...
Length: 11
*/
```

Just a warning : always create elements with their indexes next to each other. Not doing so creates `undefined` holes in array :

```js
spotifyTopTen[15] = "Water Ripples";
console.log(spotifyTopTen);

/*
[
  'The Nights',     'Paint My Soul',
  'Send Them Off!', 'Everlasting',
  'Good Grief',     "Hangin'",
  'Soy Yo',         'Walk',
  'Hey Brother',    'My Blood',
  <5 empty items>,  'Water Ripples'
]
*/
```

See the '5 empty items'? This is what I'm talking about. When we try accessing them, we get `undefined`.

#### Removing array elements

Now let's remove the extra fittings in our array. Say, we now want the Spotify Top 5 to remain and the rest to be gone. We shall use `pop()` method :

```js
for (let i=spotifyTopTen.length-1; i>=5; i--)
{
    spotifyTopTen.pop(spotifyTopTen[i]);
}
console.log(spotifyTopTen);

/*
[
  'The Nights',
  'Paint My Soul',
  'Send Them Off!',
  'Everlasting',
  'Good Grief'
]
*/
```

We used a for-loop to eliminate the last five entries in an array and then returned the finished list.

> Do keep in mind that `push()` and `pop()` do their operations in the end of the array and not in the middle of it.

Another way of doing this is ``shift()`` :

```js
let removedElement = spotifyTopTen.shift();
console.log(removedElement + '\n');
console.log(spotifyTopTen);
```
