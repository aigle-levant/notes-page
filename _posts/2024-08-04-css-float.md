## Flow

> Refer -> [CSS Flow Layout - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flow_layout)

**Flow layout** [aka normal flow] is the way block and inline elements are displayed on a page before stylesheet rules change their layout.

* Inline elements are laid out horizontally. This is called **horizontal flow**.
* Meanwhile, block elements are laid out vertically. This is called **vertical flow**.

### Changing the flow

We can break the rules and let our block elements be horizontal and inline elements be vertical using ``float`` property.
