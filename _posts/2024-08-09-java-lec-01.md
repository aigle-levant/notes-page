## Characteristics of Java

![alt text](../images/img42.png)

* **Platform independent** : Programs are compiled into bytecode and can be run on any platform using a virtual machine.
* **Object-oriented** : Java is one of the most recommended languages for learning OOP.
* **Simplicity** : Simple and easy to use.
* **Familiarity** : Familiar to C++, C programmers
* **Robustness** : Has features like automatic garbage collection and exception handling
* **Security** : Built-in security features and private and public classes.

> Robustness : The ability of a system, model, etc. to perform effectively and without failure when its variables are altered.

### Bytecode

Bytecode is a set of instructions for Java Virtual Machine [JVM] received after the compiler compiles a program.

This appears in form of the `.class` file next to a Java program [we can't open it as it IS technically machine code]. JVM tells the processor how much resources are to be allocated to it for calling the program.

After that, bytecode is interpreted into actual machine code [binary] and then program is executed.

## Principles of OOP

* **Encapsulation** : Bundle data and methods into a single unit called class; hide the inner workings of a class and show only what is necessary to the end user
* **Inheritance** : A class [child] can re-use attributes and methods from another class [parent or super-class]
* **Polymorphism** : Objects of different classes can share a method or two; can be treated as members of a common super-class; supports method overloading
* **Abstraction** : Hiding the program's complexities from the user; show only what's necessary

### Benefits

* **Modularity** : Program is split into separate modules
* **Re-usability** : Classes and objects can be re-used across different programs
* **Maintainability** : Code's more organised and easier to modify
* **Scalability** : Applications can scale up or down according to system

## Class fundamentals

A **class** is a blueprint for creating an object.

```java
public class coffee
{
    private String brand;
    private double price;

    public coffee(String brand, double price)
    {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.price = price;
    }

    //object reference variables or getters
    public String getBrand()
    {
        return this.brand;
    }
    public double getPrice()
    {
        return this.price;
    }
    public void setBrand(String brandName)
    {
        this.brand = brandName;
    }

    public String toString()
    {
        return (getBrand() + " -- " + getPrice());
    }
}
```

An **object** is an instance of an class [or rather, a way to implement features of a class into our program]. Its state, type and actions are determined by its class.

An object is brought into life using a **constructor**, a special method that creates an object out of its instance variables.

```java
public class coffee
{
    private String brand;
    private double price;

    public coffee(String brand, double price)
    {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
```

`this` is a keyword that refers to an object's instance.

**Attributes** are the properties of an object. They're also called its instance variables.

Actions are defined by the methods in the class. **Methods** are named literals acting like functions inside a class that can be called using an object.

```java
coffee cappuccino = new coffee("Cappuccino", 250.50);

System.out.println(getBrand());

System.out.println(cappuccino);
```

**Getters** [also known as object reference variables] are methods used to 'get' a value from the object [usually its instance variables]. This allows us to maintain the principle of encapsulation.

```java
coffee cafe = new coffee("Cappuccino", 250.50);

System.out.println("Coffee name?");
String str = scanner.nextLine();

cafe.setBrand(str);
```

### Method overloading

It is the process of defining multiple methods for different purposes. First, let's try using our constructor method :

```java
public class coffee
{
    private String brand;
    private double price;
    private double rating;

    public coffee(String brand, double price, double rating)
    {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.price = price;
        this.rating = rating;
    }
    public coffee(String brand, double price)
    {
        this(brand,price,0);
    }
}
```

Now let's try using methods :

```java
public class coffee
{
    //statements go here
    public double orderSum(double a, double b)
    {
        return (a+b);
    }
    public double orderSum(double a, double b, double c)
    {
        return (a+b+c);
    }
}
```

### Objects as parameters

We can use objects as our parameters. Here's how we do to compare two objects :

```java
public boolean checkEqual(coffee compareOrder)
{
    if (this == compareOrder)
    {
            return true;
    }
        
    coffee order = (coffee) compareOrder;

    if (this.brand.equals(order.brand) && this.price.equals(order.price))
    {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

We can also return objects.

```java
public class coffee
{
    //statements go here
    public void createOrder(String brand, double price)
    {
        return new coffee(brand, price);
    }
}
```

### Access controls

These control the visibility of class members.

* public : Accessible from anywhere
* private : Accessible only within the class
* protected : Accessible within the package and included sub-classes
* (default) : Accessible within same package

> A package is a folder inside which classes are stored. We have to include ``package folderName;`` at the top of our program in case it's inside a folder.

#### ``final``

This attribute prevents a variable's value from being changed.

#### ``static``

This makes a class member belong to a class rather than the instance of a class [which is an object].

## Recursion

It is a process where a method calls itself until the base condition is reached.

## Statements in Java

### Control statements

#### If statement

```java
if (str.equals(""))
{
    break;
}
```

#### If else statement

```java
if (str.equals(""))
{
    break;
}
else
{
    continue;
}
```

#### If else-if ladder

```java
if (str.equals(""))
{
    break;
}
else-if (str.equals("No"))
{
    System.out.println("Are you sure?");
    if (scanner.nextLine.equals("Yes"))
    {
        break;
    }
    else
    {
        continue;
    }
}
else
{
    continue;
}
```

### Iterative statements

#### For loop

```java
for (int i=0; i<=arr.length; i++)
{
    System.out.print(i);
}
```

#### While loop

```java
int i=10
while (i>0)
{
    System.out.println("Real");
    i--;
}
```

#### Do-while loop

```java
int i = 10;
do
{
    System.out.println("Real");
    i--;
}
while (i>0);
```

#### For-each loop

```java
for (coffee i:list)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Type conversion

Type conversion refers to conversion of a variable's data type to another data type.

### Implicit conversion or widening

This is automatically done when converting from a smaller to a larger type.

```java
int sum = 10;
double percentage = sum / 100;
```

### Explicit conversion or narrowing

This is done manually when converting from a larger to a smaller type using a technique called casting

```java
int sum = 10;
int n = 4;
double average = (double) sum / n;
int number = (int) average;
```

## Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They have a fixed size.

```java
//single-dimensional
int[] list = new int[5];
list[0] = 1;

int[] listDeux = {1,2,3,4,5};

//multi-dimensional
int[][] multiList = new int [2][3];
multiList[0][1] = 100;
```

```java
//printing array elements using a for-loop
int[] listDeux = {1,2,3,4,5};
for (int i=0; i<=list.length; i++)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
